Evaluate the current file against the following criteria. If it is not a component or related file, respond with "N/A".

- All colors should come from the `semanticColors` token. New code should NOT use `colors`.
- All sizes should use the `sizing` token. New code should NOT use `spacing`.
- All user-readable text should be wrapped in i18n functions like `t` or `plural`. Double check that they are using `doNotTranslate` or `doNotTranslateYet` intentionally. They should have a very good reason for ignoring any i18n lint rules.
- Use typography components like `Heading` and `BodyText`. New code should NOT use `Heading(Large|Medium|Small)` or `Body`.

Respond with a brief summary of any issues or follow-up questions in bulleted list with emoji keys for success, fail, or N/A status.
